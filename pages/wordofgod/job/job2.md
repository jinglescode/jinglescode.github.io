In the previous chapter, Job's possessions and children were taken away from him, and he did not sin against God; he still retained his integrity (v3). Satan suggested that Job did not curse God because that would bring punishment of God directly on himself (v4-skin for skin). Job is more willing to lose his children and his possession than losing his own life. So Satan suggested allowing physical sufferings, as physical pain is more constant than the pain that came from losing things "outside" of Job, he might curse God. God allows us to be tested, and go through suffering, to test our faith.

Amid physical suffering, Job's wife suggested to Job to curse God and die (v9). I guess that she thought that it is a good idea, better to die than to suffer like this. Or she could be used by Satan to shaken Job's faith in God. But Job stood firm, calling her "foolish", lacking discernment (v10). Having suffered physically, lost children and possession, and wife trying to "brainwash" him, Job did not sin.

We need to be grounded in God's word and know His character. Because people around us might influence us and give us suggestions out of logic and what they think and what they believe in. We really have to be careful with our thoughts, what we take in daily should be about knowing God, so that it can strengthen us in the days of trouble, so we won't be influenced by the message the comes from media, people around us, or even our own thoughts.
