Job, was a blameless and upright man (v1), and God affirmed it in (v8). He fears God and shuns evil (v8), he offered burnt offering on behalf of their children because they might have sinned or cursed God during their feasting (v5). He was wealthy, very wealthy–owned thousands of animals, has many children, and was the greatest man among all the people (v2-3). All these were blessings from God (v10).

Satan thinks that Job's godliness is due to the protection and blessings that were given by God (v10), and Satan was sure that Job would curse God if everything was taken away from Job (v11). God allowed Satan to destroy Job, but not hurt Job himself (v12). God allowed us to get tested and to go through hardship.

In a short period, Satan destroyed Job's blessings; he lost his animals and children (v13-19). It's interesting to know Satan used "fire of God from heaven" (v16) and "mighty wind" (v19) so that Job would think these damages were from God. All these damages were done up to the limit that God has allowed Satan to do.

Job's has an unshaken commitment to God; he did not sin nor curse God for his losses. Instead, he mourned for the damages (tore robe and shaved head) and fell to the ground in worship (v20). Despite his circumstances and feelings, he did choose to worship (v21-Lord be praised) and acknowledge God sovereignty (v21-Lord gave and the Lord has taken away). Job loved God more than his earthly possessions.

- God can bless his people, and he can take them away.
- God allows hardships to test our faith.
- God is always in control, as he determines the limitation of damages could be done on Job.
- God is worthy to be blessed and praised in any circumstances.
