Bildad also suggested to Job that he should repent. He believes that God is just, that punishment only happened to sinners. Sin had caused Job's suffering, sin had killed his children. He suggested that his children had received what they deserved, and Job should repent, if not, he will face the same outcome. If you are pure and upright" suggest that Job isn't, and he should earnestly seek God and seek repentance. But we know that is not true, because God affirmed that Job is blameless. Bildad continued to suggest reasons why Job is suffering based on his experiences and knowledge (v11-18).

Bildad summarises that there are 2 kinds of people, those who are blameless and those who are evildoers. God blesses those who are blameless, God will not reject those who are blameless. Laughter and joy for the blameless, whereas shame and destroyed for the wicked. (v20-22)

- We are like Bildad, quick to conclude based on what we know. Bildad was wrong to assumed Job was sinful. We need to seek God,  rather than only seek our own understanding.
